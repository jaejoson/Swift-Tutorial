# Swift-Tutorial
Exploring Swift for my personal interest through Xcode

As a member of the iphone society, I have been exposed to the world of iOS apps and the multitude of new apps that come
forth daily. It was not until I saw a presentation within Zip Code Wilmington that I actually realized how accessibile and
available Swift and Xcode truly was. Not only did the whole process seem interesting, but it also seemed like something that I
could utilize for my personal project since I wanted to create an app for my phone - accessible, portable, and functional. 

Correlations that I have found: 
- it is similar to Java and JavaScript in many ways
- the naming conventions are lengthy
- the simulator is a wonderful component to see and create exactly what I envision
- the documentation for Swift does end up aging quickly - tutorials from last year are already "behind"
- the guides are helpful, and it does seem like it would require some time to master - lengthy process, but doable with time
and Google
